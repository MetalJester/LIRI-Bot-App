# LIRI-Bot-App

#######Welcome to my Liri Bot node app. You can use several different commands to look up movies, songs, and concerts. This app requires the installation of Node-Spotify-API, Axios, Moment, and DotEnv in order to run. You can do this by using the command "npm install." You will also need to acquire your own Spotify "client id" and "client secret" which can be found by visiting: https://developer.spotify.com/my-applications/#!/. This app can only be run in the command terminal. Once open in the command terminal, the user can use the following commands to gain information about the different topics specified above:

*Use the command “movie-this” to find details about any movie from the OMDB API.

*Use the command “spotify-this-song” to look up your favorite song on the Spotify API.

*Use the command “concert-this” to find upcoming concerts from your favorite artists.

*If no concerts are currently advertised, it will let you know.

*The last function “do-what-it-says” use the node File System npm to read a text file and perform a command.
